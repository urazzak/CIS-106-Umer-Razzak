# CIS106UmerRazzak


## Assignment 1
My name is Umer Razzak, and this is my very first computer class. My goal is to earn a undergraduate degree in CIS and further my education. I am currently working as a Scrum Master. My goal for this course is to learn about coding, I currently have little knowledge. One subject that is growing rapidly is AWS (Amazon Web Services) , and the language I have chosen is Python. I want to be able to understand coding and be able to apply it at my work place to help developers solution issues, or understand what they are talking about when refining user stories. 


## Assignment 2
During session two I learned the importance of commenting changes to my source code when uploading into a shared repository. This will initially help co-developers identify key fixes or changes in the code. The Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE) I chose to test my source code was Visual Studio Code, and the language for the tool is Python. (However for this activty I wrote my program in JAVA Script.) The reason I chose this tool was because I have seen it many times in my work enviroment, and recognized it right away. I beleive using this tool throughout the course will help me apply practical knowledge in the work enviroment.
