# CIS106UmerRazzak


## Assignment 1
My name is Umer Razzak, and this is my very first computer class. My goal is to earn a undergraduate degree in CIS and further my education. I am currently working as a Scrum Master. My goal for this course is to learn about coding, I currently have little knowledge. One subject that is growing rapidly is AWS (Amazon Web Services) , and the language I have chosen is Python. I want to be able to understand coding and be able to apply it at my work place to help developers solution issues, or understand what they are talking about when refining user stories. 


## Assignment 2
During session two I learned the importance of commenting changes to my source code when uploading into a shared repository. This will initially help co-developers identify key fixes or changes in the code. The Integrated Development Enviroment (IDE) I chose to test my source code was Visual Studio Code, and the language for the tool is Python. (However for this activty I wrote my program in JAVA Script.) The reason I chose this tool was because I have seen it many times in my work enviroment, and recognized it right away. I beleive using this tool throughout the course will help me apply practical knowledge in the work enviroment.


## Assignment 3
In this session I learned the importance of assigning values and constants in our code. Also, being able to identify specific pieces of code using case sensitive language. It is crucial when referring back to a certain variable as an identifier. There is a lot of information in Chapter 2 and 3 of the book, one thing that helped me along the way of this chapter was tabulating all the different data types and identifiers in Excel.


## Assignment 4
During this session we continued on the importance of functions and how breaking down or modularizing can help us create a cleaner, and much easier to read program. Essentially this will give testers and peer programmers the ability de-bug, and update our programs. Creating functions help us leverage code that is already written instead of having to restart each time we need to update or create new code. The programming language I chose for this activity is Python as there is vast documentation, and notes to help you write your code. The IDE I have chosen is Visual Studio Code.


## Assignment 5
This session was a bit confusing for me at first, but I was able to understand the concepts and apply them within my code. The video was very helpful that the professor provided to us. I am still having a little trouble on how to return multiple variable from a particular function.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ In the second activity I wanted to create one function to prompt the user for both input values and then pass them to other functions. I was not able to do this and ended up having to create separate functions.


## Assignment 6
In this session we learned the importance of IF statements and nested IF statments. It is definitely more beneficial to have your IF statements nested within your program, if you would like it to follow a seqential flow like creating an exam for a student. However it is possible to "un-nest" the nested IF statements this would provide us the program the ability to select between multiple options. This would be preffered if the program is complex like a video game!
