# Assignment 1
My name is Umer Razzak, and this is my very first computer class. My goal is to earn a undergraduate degree in CIS and further my education. I am currently working as a Scrum Master. My goal for this course is to learn about coding, I currently have little knowledge. One subject that is growing rapidly is AWS (Amazon Web Services) , and the language I have chosen is Python. I want to be able to understand coding and be able to apply it at my work place to help developers solution issues, or understand what they are talking about when refining user stories.
